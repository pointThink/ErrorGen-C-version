# ErrorGen C# version
It's ErrorGen but written in C# (duh)

It's practically the same thing but in the form of a console application

It's not very polished as it is only a project to help me learn C# so if you have any problems with it use the way better and more polished python version https://github.com/pointThink/ErrorGen
